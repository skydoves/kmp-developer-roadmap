The Kotlin Multiplatform Developer Roadmap provides learning paths for understanding [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) development, including relevant libraries and technology stacks for various topics. To navigate the roadmap, follow the central line path, which outlines a structured progression through different concepts. <br>

Each node represents key aspects of Kotlin Multiplatform, including platform concepts, SDKs, commonly used libraries, and practical solutions. For more details on specific terms and foundational concepts, you may find it helpful to refer to [Introduction to Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform-get-started.html) or explore GitHub repositories for further examples and resources. <br>

> [!WARNING]  
> Remember, **you don‚Äôt need to learn everything from this roadmap**. Focus on the sections that are most relevant to you and your current needs. This material is not meant to serve as a comprehensive guide or textbook for becoming a Kotlin Multiplatform Developer; it's a flexible resource to help you learn based on your individual situation. **Think of it as a set of suggestions rather than a mandatory learning path for every topic covered**.
